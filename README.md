# UiO-FYS5429-Higgs-ML-Challenge
A couse project for the couse FYS5429 at the University of Oslo with the HiggsML challenge

Overview over scripts:

read-data.py: makes the datasets used for the neural network

neural-network.py: runs the neural network on the datafiles from read-data.py

grid-seach.py: runs a grid seach using neural-network.py

multi-grid-seach.py: runs multiple grids using grid-seach.py

plotting.py: plots the output from a single training

plot-all.py: plots all output from a grid search
