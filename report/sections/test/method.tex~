\section{Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for nuclear physics in broad strokes}


 Statistics, data science, and AI/ML form important fields of research
 in modern science. They describe how to learn and make predictions
 from data, and enable the extraction of key information about
 physical processes and the underlying scientific laws based on large
 datasets. As such, recent advances in AI capabilities are being
 applied to advance scientific discoveries in the physical sciences.




Ideally, AI represents the science of building models to perform a
task without being explicitly programmed. ML tasks fall under the
broader AI umbrella. We will henceforth refer to the methods discussed
as ``AI/ML''. The idea is that there exist generic algorithms which
can be used to find patterns in a broad class of datasets without
having to write code specifically for each problem. The algorithm
builds its own logic based on the data. The attentive reader should
however always keep in mind that machines and algorithms are to a
large extent developed by humans. The choice of a specific AI/ML
algorithm is governed by the insights and knowledge about a specific
system.



There exist many AI/ML approaches; they are often split into two main
categories, supervised and unsupervised. In supervised learning, data
are labeled and one lets a specific ML algorithm learn and deduce
patterns in the datasets. This allows one to make predictions about
future events and/or data not included in the training set.  On the
other hand, unsupervised learning is a method for finding patterns and
relationship in datasets without any prior knowledge of the
system. Many researchers also operate with a third category, dubbed
reinforcement learning. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by
behavioral psychology, where actions are learned to maximize reward.
One may encounter reinforcement learning being accompanied by
supervised deep learning methods. Furthermore, what is often referred
to as semi-supervised learning, entails developing algorithms that aim
at learning from a dataset that includes both labeled and unlabeled
data.
